We’ll first look at the landscape of data quality related open source libraries and look at a few examples such as pydqc, datagristle, bulwark, dvc, dedupe, and others, to give you an idea of the space. 

In the second half, we will take a closer look at Great Expectations, one of the most popular open source Python packages for data validation and documentation.
